# Randomized optimization
## The purpose of this project is to explore random search.

They are two programs:

1. **Diabetes_optimization:**  
	A comparison of four algorithm on Neural network:  
	* Randomized Hill Climbing
	* Simulated Annealing
	* Genetic Algorithm
	* Gradient descent (baseline)
	
2. **3 optimization problem:**  
A comparison of four algorithm:  
	* Randomized Hill Climbing
	* Simulated Annealing
	* Genetic Algorithm
	* MIMIC
